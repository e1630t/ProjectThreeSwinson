# ProjectThreeSwinson
A program that sorts a list of items and shows their frequencies in various ways.

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was meant to give the user a varity of ways to input a list of items and read the frequency of these items in a varity of ways and then print out a list.

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
My code could have benifited from a try/catch statement in the main loop.

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
It was the most difficult to get the input into the map correctly. This was my first time using maps and I had to learn a lot of information in a short span of time.
Thankfully through trial, error, and many stack overflow visits I was able to find my issues one by one.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
With every class I take, I take more coding logic with me. This project I particulary enjoyed becuase it was very unconvoluted, very logical.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made sure to keep the code simple and straight forward. I clearly labelled each function.
The only code that is unneccessary and unhelpful is the .h file. I only used this and included it becuase it was required that I demonstrate object orientation. I created a class but there was no reason to implement it further. The program works perfectly as is.
